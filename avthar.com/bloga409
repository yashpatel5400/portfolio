<p class="">Today marks a major milestone in my creative journey. Every week for the past year, I’ve written and published a newsletter. At first, it was read by just 5 people (family and friends that I pestered to sign up), but today my newsletter, <a href="https://avthar.substack.com/"><span><strong>Avthar’s Weekly Wisdom</strong></span></a>, is read by hundreds of people from all over the world every week.</p><p class="">I’m a big believer in the power of reflection. So I looked back at all the writing, publishing and promotion I did over the past 52 weeks and set out to extract 52 lessons I learned from the experience. The result of my reflection is this essay, which contains 86 lessons I learned from writing and publishing weekly over the past year (34 more than planned!). They range from lessons about writing and being a creator, to things that my undertaking has taught me about myself and about life.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Treat this essay as a buffet: Skip around, read what you’re interested in and come back for seconds (and thirds!).&nbsp;</p><p class=""><strong>The lessons are grouped into the following categories:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Why Write?</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">On What to Write About</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">On Writing Well</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">On Creating Consistently</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">On Audience Building and Sharing Your Work</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">On What Writing Taught Me About Myself</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">On What Writing Taught Me About Life</p></li></ul><p class="">Here are 7 some of my favorites to whet your appetite:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>#11: Write for your children (and grandchildren)</strong> (From <em>Why Write?</em>)</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>#16: Write what you would like to read. </strong>(From <em>On What to Write About</em>)</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>#29: Deadlines inspire decisiveness.</strong> (From <em>On Writing Well</em>)</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>#41: Your brain is for having ideas, not holding them.</strong> (From <em>On Creating Consistently</em>)</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>#49: There’s a difference between why you write and why your audience will read.</strong> (From <em>On Audience Building and Sharing Your Work</em>)</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>#73: You do your best work when you don’t compete.</strong> (From <em>On What Writing Taught Me About Myself</em>)</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>#84: Criticism and praise are the same demon in different disguises. Pay no attention to either one.</strong> (From <em>On What Writing Taught Me About Life</em>)</p></li></ul><p class="">I hope these 86 lessons about writing, creating and life help you live better, or at least, teach you something small.&nbsp;</p><p class="">PS: You can join me for the next 52 weeks of my journey to create and serve by subscribing to <a href="https://avthar.substack.com/"><span>my weekly newsletter</span></a> about self-mastery, entrepreneurship, health and happiness, where you’ll discover one thing that helps you change your life every week.</p><hr /><h2>Why Write?</h2><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Writing is worthwhile for its own sake.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Like all of life’s finest pleasures, writing is an end in itself. The challenge of finding the right structure, sequencing and phrasing in order to translate feelings and thoughts into words on the page is extremely satisfying in its own right.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="">Writing is also immensely enjoyable. I had the most fun when I was writing stuff I was genuinely interested in.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Writing is an outlet for self-expression.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Writing consistently ensures that the pipes of expression remain unclogged and smooth-flowing.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Writing is a great way to make new friends (and reconnect with old ones).</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">I’ve been fortunate to meet many sincere folks during the past year.

And shoutout to everyone else I met through Write of Passage!</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Writing improves your thinking.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Writhing has helped me clarify what I think (e.g <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/growth-mindset"><span>Everything is a Skill</span></a>, <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/the-bruce-lee-method-of-learning"><span>The Bruce Lee Method of Learning</span></a>).</p></li><li><p class="">Writing weekly helped me compress, crystalize and package lessons I’ve learned during my life&nbsp; (e.g <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/internal-scorecard"><span>The Internal Scorecard</span></a>, <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/the-founder-mentality"><span>The Founder Mentality</span></a>).&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="">The most rewarding writing was about topics (I thought) I already knew about (e.g <a href="https://avthar.substack.com/p/-why-you-have-your-best-ideas-in"><span>Why you have your best ideas in the shower</span></a>). After condensing all my mental frameworks in one place and connecting previously disparate ideas, I left with a deeper understanding of the topic than when I started.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Writing is cathartic.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Writing helped me reflect on my past, work through difficult times, and deal with difficult topics. (e.g <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/self-worth-and-mental-health"><span>Self Worth</span></a>, <a href="https://avthar.substack.com/p/black-lives-matter-tend-to-the-garden"><span>Black Lives Matter</span></a>, <a href="https://avthar.substack.com/p/vision-and-purpose"><span>Purpose and Vision</span></a>)</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Writing helps avoid the illusion of knowing.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">The illusion of knowing happens when you think you know a topic well, but when you sit down to explain it, you realise that you actually have gaps in understanding. Writing helps you spot these gaps in your logic and deepens your understanding.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Writing is the </strong><a href="https://avthar.com/blog/resume-is-dead"><span><strong>new resume</strong></span></a><strong>.</strong></p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Publish to democratize access to your learnings.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">My writing journey started when I compiled my advice and tools for success for new students at my alma mater, United World College Costa Rica (the doc lives on at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RDJCGhLT3-nLk2L8VF-JuUUDRvAImgUYSfBrfNWAl0k/edit?usp=sharing"><span>How to Succeed at Learning at UWC</span></a>)</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Writing helps scale your impact.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">I wrote several articles about things I had individually explained to people I mentored or students who came to me for advice (e.g <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/how-to-network"><span>How to Network</span></a>, <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/resume-is-dead"><span>Content is the New Resume</span></a>, <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/strengths"><span>How to find Strengths</span></a>, <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/how-to-find-your-dream-job"><span>How to find your Dream Job</span></a>).&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="">Now they are resources that can help anyone in the world, even if I’ve never met them. And I think that’s amazing.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Write for your grandparents.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">The thing I’m most proud of after a year of writing is getting a message from my grandmother back in South Africa telling me that she reads my articles every week and that she’s proud of me. (This was during the height of the COVID pandemic here in New York.) It made me realize that writing is truly worthwhile, even as a means sharing our thoughts with those close to us.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="">I’m grateful for the support and encouragement from my family, especially my parents, grandparents and uncles.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Write for your children (and grandchildren).</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">What would you want them to know about you, your life and how to live well?</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Write for your past self.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">This is both the easiest and most difficult sort of writing, It’s easy to think of ideas, it’s much more difficult to be honest and sincere (e.g <a href="https://avthar.substack.com/p/what-to-read-before-starting-a-startup"><span>What to read before starting a startup</span></a>, which talks about resources I wish I read before starting my first startup, which failed.)</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Write to reflect.</strong></p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Write to help.</strong></p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Write because you cannot help but write.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">My answer to the question of “Why write?” is best summed up by an Alan Watts quote about why he gives public talks:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class=""><em>“So you might say, then, why do I talk?&nbsp;</em></p><p class=""><em>You might ask the sky, Why are you blue?&nbsp;</em></p><p class=""><em>The clouds, Why do you float around?&nbsp;</em></p><p class=""><em>Birds, Why do you sing?”</em></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h2>On What to Write About</h2></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Write what you would like to read.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">This is the easiest way to be consistent, find your voice, develop your brand and find content-audience-author fit.</p></li><li><p class="">In the words of <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1157147338751668225?s=20"><span>Paul Graham</span></a>: “How to make something people want? Make something <em>you</em> want”</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>The act of writing helps you find your voice.</strong></p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Write the most helpful thing you can right now.</strong></p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Write the most truthful thing you can right now.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Hemingway, whenever he was stuck in his writing, would tell himself to write one true thing. A true sentence. Then, he would write another. And another. (h/t “Live Your Truth” by <a href="https://twitter.com/kamalravikant"><span>Kamal Ravikant</span></a>).</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>What are the things you can’t not write? Write that.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Write what you feel absolutely compelled to write about, not what you think you should.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>You don’t have to have all the answers.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">It’s easier to write what you truly believe than it is to masquerade that you have all the answers.</p></li><li><p class="">Your exploration of the complexity of a problem is worthwhile enough. Your perspective is enough. That’s better than creating prescriptions that wriggle to fit all life situations and contexts.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Share things you like.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Writing isn’t always about conveying ideas. You can share books you’ve liked (e.g <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/2021-essential-reading-list"><span>My 2021 Essential Reads</span></a>), people you admire (e.g <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/jw-curation"><span>Josh Waitzkin</span></a>, <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/the-bruce-lee-method-of-learning"><span>Bruce Lee</span></a>), articles you’ve found useful (<a href="https://avthar.substack.com/p/what-to-read-before-starting-a-startup"><span>e.g startup advice</span></a>)</p></li><li><p class="">Everyone values trusted recommendations.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Write so that even if no one reads it, it would have been worthwhile.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">The best example of this is “Meditations” by Marcus Aurelius, which was Aurelius’ thoughts to himself, which he never intended for anyone else to read.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>What feels obvious to you is often most insightful to others.</strong></p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Of course you have worthwhile things to say. Just look at your life!</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">I struggled with having “writing-worthy” ideas. I overcame it by realizing that I’ve written and said things worth sharing in the past. (e.g talks, presentations, podcast appearances, work projects, conversations). All I needed to do was re-package these into writing form.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Conversations are a great source of inspiration for writing, and vice versa.</strong></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h2>On Writing Well</h2></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Embrace empty space.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Start writing early, write what you can and then step back. Let your ideas swirl in your subconscious. Then come back to the page with renewed clarity and insight.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>The more sleeps in a writing cycle, the better the final draft.</strong></p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Deadlines inspire decisiveness.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">I set weekly deadlines to publish on Sunday and hold myself to them</p></li><li><p class="">Looming deadlines help you decide what to cut and what to include. Time pressure forces you to take action and make decisions that you’d otherwise put off.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Make it easy for your reader to convince themselves to keep reading.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Make your writing easy to read. Even better, make it easy to skim. Make your most important points stand out. Make it easy to find what’s interesting, fast. Set scroll-stopping hooks. Don’t bury the lede.</p></li><li><p class="">I make generous use of space, images and typography differences to try to achieve this.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Write for a specific person first, then generalize if absolutely necessary.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">It was easy for me to compile <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RDJCGhLT3-nLk2L8VF-JuUUDRvAImgUYSfBrfNWAl0k/edit?usp=sharing"><span>my advice to students at UWC</span></a>. I had attended that international school and was familiar with the learning environment. I’m glad I didn’t try to write “How to Succeed in High School”, because there’s too many situational corner cases to get bogged down in.</p></li><li><p class="">Ironically, writing for a specific person generates principles which can translate to a wider audience. For instance, my essays on <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/internal-scorecard"><span>internal scorecard</span></a>, <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/growth-mindset"><span>growth mindset</span></a> and <a href="https://avthar.substack.com/p/top-5-time-management-tools-from"><span>learning tools</span></a> all came out of that document aimed at high school students.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Reading writers you like helps you write better.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">I went back and created a list of <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/2021-essential-reading-list"><span>my favorite books to re-read </span></a>so that I can absorb the good writing style, explanatory methods and vocabulary subconsciously just by being exposed to it.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Clear writing is clear thinking.</strong></p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Difficult doesn’t mean good. Easy doesn’t mean bad.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Sometimes the topic which requires the least research and synthesis leads to the best writing.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Trouble usually comes from trying to do too much in one piece.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Trying to do too much in a single essay is the easiest way to never publish.</p></li><li><p class="">It’s okay to break things up and leave things for next week (I first learned this with my series on <a href="https://avthar.substack.com/p/how-to-find-your-strengths-part-1"><span>How to Find Your Strengths</span></a>)</p></li><li><p class="">Sometimes the email length limit tells you this, other times it’s your girlfriend/editor.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Structure and constraints foster creativity.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">I do my best writing when it's highly structured with headings, sub-headings and other sign-posts. This helps readers navigate the piece and find interesting things quickly.</p></li><li><p class="">I changed the structure of my newsletter after 29 weeks to be more constrained, which has helped me both publish consistently and deliver value to readers every week. I went from writing full essays on a single topic, to sharing something helpful about 4 constant topics: Self-mastery, Entrepreneurship, Health and Happiness. This new format gives readers a consistent brand promise about what they’ll get when they open the newsletter every week, but also helps me feature my longer essays under one of the topic headings.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Keep a cutting room floor.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">At the end of my drafts, I keep a collection of good ideas which didn’t quite fit or make the cut for that essay. I return to this cutting room floor to find inspiration for future writing and newsletter editions.</p></li></ul><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h2>On Creating Consistently</h2></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>It shouldn’t feel like a chore.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">If it’s not fun, you’re doing it wrong</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>You can always save things for next week.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">You don’t have to write all you can every week. You don’t have to publish all you’ve written every week.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Strike while the iron is hot.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">While you have inspiration to write on a topic, do it immediately. Otherwise, when inspiration leaves, you’ll never get to it. There’s at least a dozen unfinished essays sitting in my drafts that taught me this lesson.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Your brain is for having ideas, not holding them.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">When you have an idea for something worth writing about, write it down immediately.</p></li><li><p class="">Capturing ideas and jotting down your thoughts (in a journal or note-taking app) helps you create a backlog of topics and kernels for interesting pieces. This helps you write from abundance, rather than scarcity (aka a blank page).</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>The key to consistency is to write about things you’re actually curious about and interested in.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">If no one knew I was writing about this, what would I write?</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Focus on consistency not intensity.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">My goal is simple: Publish something every week.</p></li><li><p class="">It’s made writing and publishing like brushing my teeth.</p></li><li><p class=""><a href="https://avthar.com/blog/how-to-program-your-mind-for-fitness"><span>This principle applies to building any habit you want</span></a>.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Quality emerges from volume.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Some of my best essays were spur of the moment things when I was taken by inspiration.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="">My commitment to consistency and volume created the conditions for quality to emerge.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Accountability is the key to building a writing habit.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">I feel accountable to my audience to publish something every week in my newsletter.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="">I also benefited from peer-based accountability groups, where a group of writers would work on our pieces at the same time or give feedback on each other's work. There was an expectation to show up and that helped me be consistent, especially early on in my journey.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Resistance is inevitable. You must fight to overcome it.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">The book that helped me grapple with resistance was “<a href="https://blackirishbooks.com/product/the-war-of-art/"><span>The War of Art</span></a>” by Steven Pressfield and one of his other books, “<a href="https://blackirishbooks.com/product/nobody-wants-to-read-your-sht/"><span>Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t</span></a>”.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Imposter syndrome is part of the creative process.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">“The big reason is that we're all impostors.

<p class="">When you're a founder, you care the most about the success of the company. It’s the baby you’ve brought into the world and you would do everything in your power to make it grow and thrive.</p><p class="">Founders naturally work harder and longer than employees, because they’re aligned with the goals of the company. However, founders can’t do everything by themselves, that’s why they need a team to help them achieve the company’s vision. Therefore, in order for the company and the founder to be successful, founders must align and properly incentivize their team.</p><p class="">The best founders align the incentives of their team, such that each person takes on accountability and ownership over their projects. This goes beyond giving people financial incentives like salary and stock, but also ensuring that each person feels that their work is important to the team and has a meaningful impact on the people the company serves.</p><h2><strong>Applying Founder Mentality as an Employee</strong></h2><p class="">The Founder Mentality has stuck with me and boosted my career even though I’m now an employee. One of the reasons I was hired in my current job, as a <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/developer-advocate">Developer Advocate</a> at Timescale is that the CEO wanted someone with a founder’s mindset - someone with a proactive spirit, who’s able to take ownership of projects and deliver with little supervision.</p><h3><strong>“What would an owner do?”</strong></h3><p class="">Taking on a founder mentality as an employee will help you become a top performer in your field. The more you can think and act like a founder (or owner) in your job, the more likely you will be one in future. Having a founder mentality as an employee means caring about your work as much as a founder would and executing to the best of your ability.</p><p class="">It also means helping your team succeed by taking on founder-like accountability and ownership. You don’t have to be the boss, just be as helpful as possible to your teammates and help empower them to succeed in their jobs.</p><p class="">People will take notice and you’ll be rewarded with more ownership and more responsibility. Even if you don’t get promoted, practicing having a Founder Mentality will help you succeed in future when you are an owner of your own business, since you have already internalized the mindset and behaviors of a founder.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><h4><strong>“If you think like the owner and act like the owner,</strong></h4><h4><strong>it’s only a matter of time until you become the owner.”</strong></h4><h4><strong>- Naval Ravikant</strong></h4></blockquote><hr /><h2><strong>Resources</strong></h2><p class="">Resources to learn more about Founder Mentality:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-Jocko-Willink/dp/1250270960/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=extreme+ownership&amp;qid=1592603145&amp;sr=8-3"><strong>Extreme Ownership</strong></a>&nbsp;by Jocko Willink, is the foundational book on leadership for both business and life [<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-Jocko-Willink/dp/1250270960/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=extreme+ownership&amp;qid=1592603145&amp;sr=8-3">Book</a>]</p></li><li><p class=""><a href="https://nav.al/principal-agent"><strong>The Principal-Agent Problem</strong></a>&nbsp;by Naval Ravikant, goes further into the difference in incentives between principles (owners) and agents (employees).

It’s knowing who you actually are, what you’re good at and being at peace with it.</p><p class="">In an age where the internet enables even niche obsessions to thrive, I believe self-awareness is key for budding entrepreneurs and creatives to create wealth and win.</p><p class=""><strong>Self-awareness helps you pick the right areas to focus on.</strong>&nbsp;It helps you pick the right markets, industries, problems and people to explore and investigate, based on strengths, skills, curiosity and specific knowledge. These are the areas where you will have a disproportionate chance of success. While others pick areas based on what’s hot or where the money is at, you’ll choose areas that you’re naturally curious about, and play while others ‘work hard’. You’ll outlast short term prospectors and find success in the long run.</p><p class=""><strong>Self-awareness helps you achieve product-market-founder fit.</strong>&nbsp;Awareness of strengths and skills will allow you to build great products that solve problems you care about. Self-awareness helps you be the right person, with the right intuition and compass, to bring a product to market, and delight your customers. Self-awareness helps you achieve product-market-founder fit.</p><p class=""><strong>Self-awareness helps you build the best team.&nbsp;</strong>Auditing your own strengths allows you to team up with and recruit others who complement and augment you. This allows you to build an organization where everyone is aligned, engaged and using their strengths in their work.</p><p class=""><strong>Self-awareness helps you escape competition through authenticity.&nbsp;</strong>In the end, deep self-awareness allows you to win by just being your true, authentic self and doing whatever it is you’re good at. You’ll escape the competition through authenticity, because no one is better at being you -&nbsp; than you of course.</p><p class=""><strong>Self-awareness helps you win by building a personal monopoly.</strong>&nbsp;You build self-awareness by reflecting and refining the strengths, skills, interests and specific knowledge (knowledge that can’t be taught but can be learned through experience and on the job) that are unique to you. As a result, you’ll develop a personal monopoly. Just like a business can have a monopoly over a market, you have a monopoly over 2-4 intersecting areas, in which you can offer value to others.</p><p class=""><strong>How to build self-awareness?</strong></p><p class="">My essay on <a href="https://avthar.com/blog/strengths">How to Find Your Strengths</a> shares frameworks and tools that I’ve found useful in order to become more self-aware. </p><p class=""><strong>“Go all in on your strengths and don’t give a damn about what you suck at” - Gary Vaynerchuk</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e50ac0a8bf5a551ea5e5f85/1614808994997-GOV07NZIK3S8L7T0AQY4/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHJjM-Evnp5g-1kf5Yv15cUUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcpWKe3KzaCrFDKPR1a1Ob8xobjReaxMuaKtrvUDoDmPO9EsdBHei1w8jR6w0UZiby/self+awareness.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1280" height="854"><media:title type="plain">Self-awareness and startup success</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>How to Network</title><category>Career</category><dc:creator>Avthar Sewrathan</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://avthar.com/blog/how-to-network</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e50ac0a8bf5a551ea5e5f85:5e50ac72dbfcb2688ef4330b:60401327fd24be554fe20a4e</guid><description><![CDATA[How to network your way into a job in an unfamiliar industry using my

<blockquote><p class=""><em>One approach you could use (applies to non-acting jobs as well):&nbsp;</em></p><p class=""><em>(1) Go to LinkedIn and search for people in acting who are UWC alumni (filter for schools in your search). Ideally they are people who are doing jobs today that you want to do in future.</em></p><p class=""><em>(2) Get their email via your school or find a way to DM them (Facebook, LinkedIn, whatever you can find)</em></p><p class=""><em>(3) Ask to talk over a Zoom call to get advice on your journey and path forward. Alums love helping other alums, especially those figuring out their career path.</em></p><p class=""><em>(4) On the call, be sincere and curious about their path and how they got to where they are. This requires some research on them beforehand. You're genuinely just looking for help, not trying to finesse a job out of them.&nbsp;</em></p><p class=""><em>(5) Usually they will want to help and will either open doors for you themselves, or offer to connect you to someone who can open doors for you (hiring manager, decision maker, owner, CEO etc)</em></p><p class=""><em>(6) If they don't do (5), then ask who else they think would be good for you to talk to and get referrals to those people.

<p class="">Hey friends,</p><p class="">There’s a mental health epidemic going on in the world today: So many of us don’t feel good about being ourselves on a day to day basis.</p><p class="">At the root of it is self-worth.&nbsp;<strong>Self-worth</strong>, or self-esteem, is the value you place on yourself as a person.</p><p class="">I’m no expert, but from my experience, I’ve found that the cause of much of the anxiety and fear is due to&nbsp;<strong>conditional self-worth</strong>. That means basing your value as a person on things outside yourself, like money, grades and followers.</p><p class="">I’ve experienced the harms of conditional self-worth first hand, with my time in elite academic environments being a good teaching example. In school, I was fortunate to perform well academically, starting at a young age. As one of my friends comedically put it, I “ranked first since they started counting”. That earned me the label of the “smart kid”.&nbsp;</p><p class="">While working to reinforce the identity of “being smart” had benefits in the short term, like earning prizes, scholarships and acceptances to prestigious universities, in the long term it made me base my self worth on my academic performance. The result was that I determined my value as a person on external outcomes rather than internal values. This led to living in states of fear and anxiety, constantly wondering if I was doing enough to prove to the outside world that I was, indeed, “smart” enough.</p><p class="">Now I wish I could end this letter by saying, “Well that was then, but now I’m totally healed and have unconditional self-worth and love myself all the time.” The truth is that it’s still a problem I’m solving. It’s a constant battle for me, as I’m sure it is for many of you reading this. As a technology professional, I fall into the trap of basing my worth on the company I work for, the role I’m in and the salary I make. As a creator, too often I judge my worth by my subscriber numbers, Twitter followers and website visitors.</p><p class="">Basing your self-worth on external things leads to misery. Part of the reason is that external things never last. They change, they fade, they’re subject to the whims of markets and nature. One day you could be worth a billion dollars and the next day 0. Another part of the reason is that no amount of external validation will ever fill the hole of believing that you’re worthy as a person, simply because you’re you. You’ll always want more and more confirmation because you rely on the world to tell you who you are.&nbsp;</p><p class="">An antidote to conditional self-worth is understanding the root of the problem: Why do you feel that you’re worthy only because you possess or have done certain things? The answer will be different for everyone, but asking the question is an important first step to freeing yourself and giving yourself permission to be happy during your short time on earth.</p><p class="">The truth is that life is too short to be unhappy, especially when the root cause is something within your control. As the blogger&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pdf-archive.com/2017/06/27/docslide-us-delusion-damage/docslide-us-delusion-damage.pdf">Delusion Damage</a>&nbsp;said, “Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.”&nbsp;</p><p class="">Translating that to self-worth context, conditional self-worth is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy about being yourself until conditions outside your control are met.</p><p class="">Now, who in their right mind would sign such a contract?</p><p class="">I don’t have solutions, just questions to ask. I hope they help you.</p><p class="">With gratitude and love,&nbsp;</p><p class="">Avthar</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e50ac0a8bf5a551ea5e5f85/1617670445583-BSHX3D28ECZUY7X2SU2H/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKlnEJe-S6O_EkCaG3agFGRZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PI5hzhLde4hvatJsNly355ffNU5CmVUljmMZYTraQzQ-A/Self+Worth+and+Mental+Health+2.png?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="940" height="788"><media:title type="plain">Self-Worth and Mental Health</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Returning to Your Authentic Self</title><category>Self-Mastery</category><category>Learning</category><dc:creator>Avthar Sewrathan</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://avthar.com/blog/returning-to-your-authentic-self</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e50ac0a8bf5a551ea5e5f85:5e50ac72dbfcb2688ef4330b:60464ea404168202daa07b05</guid><description><![CDATA[“How much of your authentic self have you gotten away from, trying to be

<p class="">When Warren Buffet walks into a room, he doesn't need to prove that he's rich, capable or smart to anyone. Most people in the room already know that he is all those things. And the ones that don't have no impact on Buffet's $76 billion net worth. Buffet doesn't wear expensive suits and he eats McDonald's everyday. He spends most of his day reading and playing bridge. But most importantly, he's world class at investing. <strong>He's found his authentic self and lives it every day.</strong></p><p class="">Authenticity isn't something that you express only after you've made it. <strong>Being your authentic self is actually the best way to separate yourself from the competition and become successful in your chosen field.</strong> As entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant famously <a href="https://nav.al/competition-authenticity">said</a>, "<em>Escape competition through authenticity.</em>"</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Escape competition through authenticity.</p>— Naval (@naval) <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/975975798204112896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 20, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p class="">However, for many of us, we think that the secret to success lies in being something other than ourself.&nbsp;<strong>We think that we have to be like other people in order to be successful.</strong>&nbsp;That's why we're obsessed with Elon Musk's morning routine, the way Jeff Bezos makes decisions, or the way Steve Jobs treated his employees. We think that we need to change ourselves in order to be successful, when in reality, we need to return to our authentic selves. Being our authentic selves — not trying to impress anyone, not trying to gain affirmation from anyone, not trying to gain validation from anyone — is the way we will ultimately become successful. We just need to get out of our own way and let our authenticity help us win.</p><p class="">I'll never forget&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/_sOu3KJDMuc">this story</a>&nbsp;about Eric Thomas, who talked about how he moved away from his authentic self while writing his book, all just to gain acceptance from 'intellectuals'. Now, Eric was already successful while he was writing the book, he was (and still is) the number 1 motivational speaker in the world. But Eric felt he needed to change his style and change the way he spoke in order to appeal to intellectual folks, who he sought acceptance from. In his words, "<em>I got away from my authentic self trying to be what that community wanted me to be.</em>" It's no surprise that his book ended up not doing as well as he expected. Eric reflected on this experience and saw that the way he succeeded way by being authentic to himself, so in his next book, he went back to his roots and decided to speak to 80% of the population who don't have college degrees. That book was a resounding success.</p><p class="">I'll end with a question from Eric Thomas.

<h2><strong>1. Getting unhealthy is effortless. So is getting healthy.</strong></h2><p class="">In order to find a sustainable solution to a problem, we must first understand the nature of the problem itself.&nbsp;</p><p class="">How do we become unhealthy? By overeating unhealthy foods, not exercising frequently and living an unhealthy lifestyle of sleeping poorly and being stressed out all the time.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Becoming unhealthy is a by-product of an unhealthy lifestyle.</p><h4><strong>As Firas says: “You didn't go in the restaurant and say to yourself, ‘Hey, I'm going to push myself really hard. And I'm going to eat as much as I can. And I'm going to do this day in and day out, no matter how tough it is, until I get fat’...It just happens as a result of bad eating choices.”</strong></h4><p class="">Therefore if becoming unhealthy happened as a by-product of an unhealthy lifestyle, then then we should aim to construct a healthy lifestyle and habits, so that getting fit, losing weight and being more energetic is a by-product of our lifestyle.</p><p class="">Here are some examples of how you make health a by-product of your lifestyle:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Working out daily, even for 10 minutes</p></li><li><p class="">Daily intermittent fasting. What’s more effortless than not eating food?</p></li><li><p class="">Only buying healthy foods to that there’s no junk food to binge on</p></li><li><p class="">Defaulting to cooking over eating out</p></li><li><p class="">Get in the sun and get moving</p></li></ul><hr /><h2><strong>2. Being fit is like brushing your teeth</strong></h2><p class="">The gold standard for habits is brushing your teeth.</p><p class="">As Firas says, “When you wake up in the morning and you brush your teeth, you don't struggle with whether you should brush your teeth or not. You've brushed your teeth enough times...that you brush your teeth automatically. I don't care if you're sick or you're hot or you're tired, you will always brush your teeth. Why? It takes little to no mental energy. You've been doing it since you're a kid. It's a habit.”</p><h4><strong>Our aim should be to make health and fitness like brushing our teeth: an effortless habit, something that requires little to no mental energy and something that we do daily.</strong></h4><p class="">Looking closer that what makes brushing your teeth so effortless can give us insight into how we can make health and fitness (as well as other habits) effortless as well:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">We do it every day</p></li><li><p class="">We do it at the same time (in the morning and in the evening)</p></li><li><p class="">We do it in the same place</p></li><li><p class="">We have triggers (situational cues) that come before and after brushing our teeth (e.g. waking up or going to sleep)</p></li></ul><p class="">Therefore, we can those same principles to making health and fitness an effortless habit:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Do it daily</p></li><li><p class="">Do it at the same time</p></li><li><p class="">Do it in the same place (or group of places)</p></li><li><p class="">Place being healthy and fit between activities that we always do, so that they become triggers&nbsp;</p></li></ul><hr /><h2><strong>3. Be wary of too much intensity, focus on consistency instead</strong></h2>

<p class="">A surefire formula for not building effortless habits is to try to do too much too quickly. I’ve fallen into this trap before: trying to workout with too much intensity early on and ending up injured, as well as going on too extreme of a diet and falling back after a few days.</p><p class="">Too much intensity, especially early on in your health and fitness practice,&nbsp; will stop it from becoming a habit.</p><h3><strong>The secret to building a habit that lasts is to focus on consistency, not intensity.</strong></h3><p class="">Firas elaborates how prioritizing consistency helps you maintain a habit: “ I never pushed myself so far that I woke up the next day feeling like a wreck. I train every single day five to seven days a week. And I never wake up in the morning feeling hurt or busted up. Never. Because I know the next day I am going to work out again.”</p><p class="">By focusing on consistency, we make being healthy automatic. For example, if we do yoga for 10 mins a day, it becomes a part of our daily routine and becomes a lifetime habit.&nbsp;</p><p class="">The key is to not break your habit, because once you miss one day, it’s very easy to fall completely off the bandwagon. If you do miss a period of time, ensure to start again slowly so that you can remain consistent. This is why maintaining a streak of consecutive days or weeks is vital to reprogram for any habit without spending any mental energy to decide to practice that habit.</p><hr /><h2><strong>4. Start small. Build momentum. And never let go.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>“Forget your fancy training programs, forget all these crazy protocols. focus on building momentum.” - Firas Zahabi</strong></h3><p class="">Momentum is your secret weapon to reprogram your mind and make being healthy effortless. Start with the smallest thing you can think of. Get momentum and then never let go.</p><p class="">For example, Firas recommends just starting with 1 single push up every day: “Start with just one pushup… a day. Now you're going to tell me ‘Hey, coach, one pushup a day doesn't burn fat. It doesn't shred you up. It doesn't build muscle.’ Remember I am not trying to build muscle I am not trying to shred fat. I'm trying to build momentum.”</p><p class="">After you’ve built some momentum, day doing 1 push up a day for 7 days, you realise that doing 1 pushup is easy, so you will naturally progress to doing 2 pushups a day, and then 3 and 4. Eventually momentum will push you to want to do 50 pushups and adding on other exercises like squats, running, yoga etc.</p><p class="">Starting small and being consistent will guarantee you building momentum which will lead to you doing more in the long run. Contrast this to starting off by trying to do 50 push ups a day, doing it for one day and then giving up. This also applies to other habits like writing where you can aim to write 100 words per day and then progress to writing 200, 300 and then eventually to 10 pages over the course of many months.</p><h4><strong>By focusing on practicing healthy habits consistently and slowly increasing over time, we benefit from compounding returns over the rest of our life.</strong>&nbsp;</h4><hr /><h2><strong>5. Make time for health or make time for sickness. Your choice.</strong></h2><p class="">Many people say, “<em>I know I should workout, but I don’t have time. I have kids, I have a stressful job, I have all these responsibilities.”</em></p><p class="">Firas has a brilliant reply to that:</p><h4><strong>“Make time for fitness or make time for getting sick. Make time for disease, make time for getting old. Because all that stuff's gonna happen if you do not train.”</strong></h4><h4><strong>Make time for health or make time for sickness, your choice.</strong></h4><p class="">Disease and it’s associated financial and physical costs will cost you a lot more than the time it takes to workout and eat healthy daily.</p><hr /><h2><strong>6. Reframe your attitude to overcome your excuses.</strong></h2>

<p class="">You don't always have control of your circumstances, but do you have control your attitude.</p><p class="">We all have false beliefs that hold us back from being healthy and fit (or building whatever habit we’re putting off). Things like “I don’t have enough time”, “I don’t have energy to train” etc.</p><p class="">Reframing your attitude to false beliefs will reprogram your mind to see to true benefits of health and fitness. Let’s look at how we can reframe the two excuses above, “I don’t have time” and “I don’t have energy to workout”.</p><h3><strong>False Belief #1: I don’t have time to exercise</strong></h3><h3><strong>Reframe: Exercising saves me time, from sickness, illness and old age</strong></h3><p class="">Firas elaborates, “I don't see fitness as costing me time. I see training as saving me time.</p><p class="">Training equals good health. Good health equals no need to go wait at the doctor's office equals. No need to get sick... Exercise will save you time. Think about it. It's a long term project. You want to be healthy for life. It'll save you time.”</p><h3><strong>False Belief #2: I don’t have the energy to train</strong></h3><h3><strong>Reframe: Training gives me energy</strong></h3><p class="">Firas elaborates, “Training gives you energy...training has a tonic effect. Exercise has a much more powerful tonic effect than any stimulant you can take out on the market today. [When you say you don’t have to exercise].. to me, you sound like a fool. It's like saying you're too dumb to learn. It's like saying you're too hungry to eat, or you're too tired to sleep. It makes no sense. I don't have the energy to give myself energy”</p><p class="">These are but two examples of how thinking about the long term benefits of health and fitness and other habits can help reframe your perspective on common excuses you use to avoid practicing those habits.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p class="">In summary, here’s how to program your mind for fitness:</p><blockquote><h4>1. Recognize that if getting unhealthy is effortless. So is getting healthy.</h4><h4>2. Start small. Build momentum. And never let go.</h4><h4>3. Make being healthy an effortless habit, like brushing your teeth.</h4><h4>4. Be wary of too much intensity, focus on consistency instead</h4><h4>5. Make time for health or make time for sickness, your choice.</h4><h4>6. Reframe your attitude to overcome your excuses</h4></blockquote><p class="">If you’d like to watch the videos these principles came from you can do so on Firas’s Youtube channel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qMBs-KjfL0">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZMbP_pJGRk">here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e50ac0a8bf5a551ea5e5f85/1614810139695-W5NWEM31RU871H5Z01KI/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kN5NGhchmp-fBoGsT8Ypd85Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIzNo11KQtbITvMZAEwCK2gO6SQzv6eSJDRhcWLOcd9fwKMshLAGzx4R3EDFOm1kBS/fitness.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="832" height="468"><media:title type="plain">How to Program Your Mind for Fitness (or any other skill)</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Avthar’s Essential Reads for 2021</title><category>Books</category><category>Learning</category><category>Happiness</category><dc:creator>Avthar Sewrathan</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2021 06:32:04 +0000</pubDate><link>https://avthar.com/blog/2021-essential-reading-list</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e50ac0a8bf5a551ea5e5f85:5e50ac72dbfcb2688ef4330b:604649a8a9b8c45ce6dec22f</guid><description><![CDATA[It’s said that you’re better off reading the hundred or so greatest books

<h4><strong>It’s said that you’re better off reading the hundred or so greatest books of all time, over and over again, rather than reading every new book that’s published, or trying to read as many books as you can.</strong></h4><p class="">I pondered what my 100 greatest books of all time would be and which of them I’d want to re-visit in 2021.

<p class="">His greatest teaching is just one sentence long. It lays out the ultimate process for learning anything and becoming world class at it:</p><h3><em>“Research your own experience; absorb what is useful, reject what is useless and add what is essentially your own.”&nbsp;</em></h3><h3>- Bruce Lee, Wisdom for the Way</h3><p class="">The quote above captures what I call&nbsp;<strong>The Bruce Lee Method of Learning.</strong>&nbsp;It’s a meta-process which can be applied to learning and mastering any skill in any field, be it in business, writing, engineering, or art.</p><p class="">What I love most about the Bruce Lee Method of Learning, is that it rejects the existence of “one true way” or “the best method” of doing something. Instead, it&nbsp;<strong>emphasizes deciding for yourself</strong>: absorbing useful parts of different methods, rejecting parts you find to be unhelpful and ultimately remixing everything to create your own way of doing the art. It’s a process of finding your own way and creating your own style of a skill or art.</p><p class="">Bruce Lee did this himself when he created the new martial art of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeet_Kune_Do">Jeet Kune Do</a>, a hybrid philosophy which paved the way for modern mixed martial arts as we know it. However, he shut down his Jeet Kune Do schools, since he felt it would be inauthentic to teach it to others as “the way”, when he came to it through his own exploration and inquiry. Instead of teaching Jeet Kune Do to others, he felt they should use it as a means to also find their own way and absorb, reject and add from the various martial arts out there. He explains his decision in the quote below:</p><h4><strong><em>“The original founder of a style started out with a hypothesis. But now it has become gospel truth, and people who go into that become the product of it. It doesn’t matter how you are, who you are, how you are structured, how you are built or how you are made...it doesn’t seem to matter. You just go in there and be the product. And that, to me, is not right.”</em>&nbsp;</strong></h4><h4><strong>- Bruce Lee, Wisdom for the Way</strong></h4>

<p class="">Bruce Lee embodies the principle of <strong>Finding Your Own Way</strong>: not trying to copy how some successful person made it, but instead being true to yourself and finding your own path to mastery and success. He stresses the importance of independent inquiry — finding out the truth for yourself, and not being dependent on someone else’s views or the dogma of a particular school of thought:</p><h4><strong><em>&nbsp;“Whenever I look around, I always learn one thing, and that is: Always be yourself...express yourself, have faith in yourself. Do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate him.</em></strong></h4><h4><strong><em>...Independent inquiry is needed in your search for truth, not dependence on anyone else’s view or a mere book.”&nbsp;</em></strong></h4><h4><strong>-Bruce Lee, Wisdom for the Way</strong></h4><p class="">In a world where everyone is trying to sell us the “one true way” to getting rich, business growth, or a happy marriage, the Bruce Lee Method of Learning is more important than ever.&nbsp;<strong>It’s a reminder to find our own way and discover the truth for ourselves in every part of life.</strong></p><p class="">I hope that the Bruce Lee Method of Learning inspires you to find your own way in life and leads you to success and happiness.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e50ac0a8bf5a551ea5e5f85/1615221930393-LK98O7FF4O1A6CSKQLSV/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kL4gSgflSv_hSYaWSYLeUgQUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcYyArLyOj9dvAciWmUWjjhrUiWcKXSbNVcLdpHzzD2Q6FEzKiip9C8jsj4o0kqq9f/bruce+lee.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1200" height="680"><media:title type="plain">The Bruce Lee Method of Learning</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>How to find your Dream Job</title><category>Career</category><category>Self-Mastery</category><dc:creator>Avthar Sewrathan</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Mar 2021 02:35:51 +0000</pubDate><link>https://avthar.com/blog/how-to-find-your-dream-job</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e50ac0a8bf5a551ea5e5f85:5e50ac72dbfcb2688ef4330b:603e0c88522efc449c11d13d</guid><description><![CDATA[Finding fulfilling work is a conundrum of modern life.

<p class="">Take an afternoon. Sit in a quiet room. Put some classical music on. And reflect on these questions.</p><p class="">They will help you understand your definition of success, your motives for succeeding and the role of work in your life.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>What does success look like for you?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Why do you want to be successful?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What does a “good life” look like to you?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What is work? Why work? What is the role of work in your life?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What defines good or worthwhile work?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What do you really desire? Why do you want what you want?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Are your desires your own or are they influenced by others?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Who or what are you afraid to disappoint?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What are you willing to sacrifice for success? What are you not?</strong></p></li></ol><p class="">I’ve written previously about living<a href="https://avthar.com/blog/internal-scorecard"> with an internal scorecard</a>, which talked about the importance of defining success and living in accordance with your values. Answering these questions will help you avoid the trap of living life according to society’s definition of success. </p><h4><strong>Examining your motives will also help you avoid the anxiety that comes with “keeping up with the Joneses” and save you from comparing yourself to others who are running different races than you.</strong></h4><p class="">You’ll have your own convictions for success and why you want to achieve it.</p><p class="">You must both examine and&nbsp;<em>accept</em>&nbsp;your motives. Change what you can and accept what you can’t change. It’s better to be aware of what you desire and what’s driving you to prove yourself to the world and lean into that, than to blindly chase success in the hopes that it will fulfill you and finally make you happy.</p>

<h2><strong>Motives and Alignment</strong></h2><h4><strong>You can filter roles that you take on and the people you work with through your motives, discarding those that don’t align with your motivations and pursuing those that do.</strong></h4><p class="">Take the case of Shiv, who wants to start his own business:</p><blockquote><p class=""><em>After examining his motivations and the role of work in his life, Shiv came to the conclusion that he wants to work for himself for the independence and also that he isn’t willing to sacrifice time with his family and thus isn’t willing to work nights and weekends. It would be unwise for Shiv to partner with Vish, someone who also wants to start their own business but whose goal is to become as rich and powerful as possible and become the next Jeff Bezos, since their motives are woefully misaligned. Shiv should pursue a bootstrapped business, while Vish might want to pursue a high growth startup.</em></p></blockquote><p class="">Understanding your motives allows you to partner with people whose motives are aligned with your own.</p><p class="">Moreover, understanding why you want a certain job and how it fits into your life is important.&nbsp;Sometimes it's okay to take a job that doesn’t light you on fire straight away, if you understand the role it plays at your stage in life. Most often, this takes the form of jobs providing financial stability and as a source of capital to use for future projects, which can bring you more freedom later in your life.&nbsp;</p><hr /><h1><strong>2. Taste Many Things</strong></h1>

<p class="">There's a saying I heard often while growing up in South Africa: “You can't be a doctor, if you've never seen a doctor.”</p><p class="">What this means is that if you've never been exposed to a certain career or industry, you can’t imagine yourself doing it because it’s outside your mental model of how the world works.</p><h4><strong>In order to find the right role for you, you must taste many different roles and industries in order to find which ones resonate with. </strong></h4><h4><strong>This will help broaden your mental model of what’s out there and help you make the best decision.</strong></h4>

<p class="">Let your strengths and curiosity guide you as you experiment and try different things out. This process of iteration creates more opportunities to find the people and ideas that resonate with you the most.</p><h4><strong>Often, it takes a mentor, manager or someone you trust to point out possible paths for you to explore.</strong></h4><p class="">The story of how I ended up in a role that uses my unique strengths, a&nbsp;<a href="https://avthar.com/blog/developer-advocate">Developer Advocate</a>, is a prime example of this:</p><p class="">My boss was a Developer Advocate himself for many years, noticed my skills and experience and thought I’d be a natural at the role. I was hesitant at first, as I had never heard of this role before, but decided to try it out to see if I liked it. Others can expose us to possible paths, but it is up to us to explore them and see if they resonate with us.</p><h4><strong>One reason we don’t explore the possible space of careers enough is because we’re memetic creatures: we&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://avthar.com/blog/dont-outsource-thinking"><span><strong>outsource our thinking</strong></span></a><strong>&nbsp;and often want things because others desire them.</strong></h4><p class="">When we don’t have a rich picture of all the different roles that are suitable to our strengths, we end up choosing our path based on what others are doing, rather than our own convictions.</p><p class="">I saw this during my time at Princeton University, where many students chose to go into management consulting, banking or even software engineering because they saw other people doing it, and felt fear of missing out (FOMO), rather than because of their own convictions. Many people who follow the crowd end up hating their job and leave after a few years. Tasting many things and finding those that resonate helps you not fall into the same trap and waste precious years of your life.</p><h4><strong>Finding roles and industries that resonate with you is not one off process: it’s a continuous process of adaptation and iteration.</strong></h4><p class="">It’s not something you do only in college, or only in your 20s. It’s a lifelong process to find who and what needs you the most and what aligns with your unique strengths at each stage of your life.</p><h2><strong>Practical Tips to Find What Resonates With You</strong></h2><p class="">While actually doing a job is the best indicator of whether you’re well suited for it, there are ways that you can test different roles and industries to decide if they deserve further exploration.</p><h4><strong>The key here is to figure out the smallest experiment you can do in order to see if you like something.</strong></h4><p class="">Here are some ideas for experiments you can run:</p><h3><strong>Tip 1: Side projects</strong></h3><blockquote><p class="">Side projects are a low-risk way of testing your proclivity toward a role or industry.</p></blockquote><p class="">Doing projects on nights and weekends in order to test hypotheses you have about roles you enjoy or to learn about new industry trends is a great way to continue learning and refining your fit while keeping a full-time job. Don’t be afraid to start, abandon and pick up new projects. Sustained interest over time is a good indicator of whether something is a good fit for you. Moreover, these projects don’t have to be solo efforts, they’re a great opportunity to taste different things and work with different sorts of people and learn about yourself in the process.</p><h3><strong>Tip 2: Empathy Interviews</strong></h3><blockquote><p class="">Reach out to people who are doing the things you think you want to do. Build relationships with them. Find out what is it, functionally, that they do? Are you suited for that? Can you see yourself doing that?</p></blockquote><p class="">If you’re a student you could reach out to alumni from your school, if you’re in the working world, reach out to others at your company, connect through your network or through Twitter and cold email.</p><h3><strong>Tip 3: Books, Courses and Classes</strong></h3><p class="">Thanks to the internet its easier than ever to learn about the functions of a role or trends in an industry. So many people are writing, tweeting or podcasting about it. Moreover, there are many courses you can take in order to test out a career hypothesis you have. Course and other groups are a great way to meet like-minded people who can help you refine your search.</p><hr /><h1>3. Deepen Your Mastery</h1><p class="">In line with the theme of finding and doubling down on your strengths:</p><h4><strong>Your dream job is one that will help refine your strengths and push you toward mastery.</strong></h4><h4><strong>By doing the job, you’ll become world class at your strengths</strong></h4><p class="">Here are some factors to evaluate if a role can help increase your level of mastery:</p>

<h3><strong>Can the role help you become world-class at your strengths?</strong></h3><p class="">An ideal role will be one in which you can showcase and refine your strengths.</p><h4><strong>To understand if the role uses your strengths, deconstruct the role into its functional parts.</strong></h4><blockquote><p class="">Understanding exactly what someone does in a particular job is much more useful to decide if it's right for you, than judging it by the name alone.</p></blockquote><p class="">This is where the Empathy Interviews I mentioned above shine. You can reach out to people doing jobs you think you might like or want to move into and learn about what exactly they do, the skills they use and the functions they perform.</p><h3><strong>Who can you learn from?</strong></h3><h4><strong>You want to be an environment where you can learn from the people around you.</strong></h4><blockquote><p class="">Learning could be in the form of traditional mentoring from your boss or those in senior positions. It could also be learning from the example and experience of working with peers who are top performers.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p class="">Many people find themselves in good jobs’, but around people they can’t relate to and aren’t learning from. However, you should try your best to be proactive and find people who you align with in an organization and work with them as much as you can.</p><p class="">Evaluating who you can learn from in a job is perhaps the most difficult thing to judge before you join a company, but it is possible to gauge from speaking to current employees and during your interview process.</p><h3><strong>Does the industry knowledge deepen your personal monopoly?</strong></h3><blockquote><p class="">For some, an ideal role is one that helps them use and deepen industry-specific knowledge.</p></blockquote><p class="">Industry-specific knowledge could be understanding a certain target audience (e.g software developers, millennials) or how deals are done in an industry (e.g healthcare) or navigating challenges specific to a product type (e.g consumer social apps, AI regulation).</p><blockquote><p class="">These kinds of industry-specific knowledge often translates across companies and the experience could be helpful in future endeavours or when tackling similar problems.</p></blockquote><p class="">Jobs in certain industries you’re passionate about or want to become an expert in can help you learn more about an industry and cement that knowledge as part of your personal monopoly.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Further reading</strong></h3><p class="">A book that's helped me navigate my career is&nbsp;<a href="https://designingyour.life/the-book/">Designing Your Life</a>&nbsp;by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. I recommend starting with Chapter 2 on Building Your Compass.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e50ac0a8bf5a551ea5e5f85/1614913154000-O8LI2JMK107FRYOIUDFI/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kD33KhhWEodMJvcytjXFyvFZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIQVUjsvMYGrjk5P5guv3Gb1aPQrnDLhtGUJ-UJkarKCw/Dream+Job+Heading.png?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="960" height="540"><media:title type="plain">How to find your Dream Job</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>A Rolodex of Annual Review Questions</title><category>Self-Mastery</category><category>Happiness</category><dc:creator>Avthar Sewrathan</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 19:48:29 +0000</pubDate><link>https://avthar.com/blog/annual-review-questions</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e50ac0a8bf5a551ea5e5f85:5e50ac72dbfcb2688ef4330b:5ff0c9680f96794605d29ca4</guid><description><![CDATA[Six sets of annual review questions from Tim Ferriss, Shane Parrish, James

<p class="sqsrte-large"><em>Questions from Tim Ferriss, Shane Parrish, James Clear and other top performers to help you review, reflect on and re-orient your life.</em></p><p class="">Every year since 2014, I've conducted an end of year review. The practice has helped me take stock of my life, reflect on the ups and downs of the past year, and re-orient myself toward living a successful, authentic and peaceful life.</p><p class="">Here are 6 sets of questions which I've used in my annual review. They range from reflection questions that top performers like Tim Ferriss and James Clear ask themselves, to questions I randomly saved to my camera roll from anonymous sources, to questions I've composed and asked myself during my journalling practice.</p><p class="">My hope is that one of the question sets piques your interest enough to set aside an hour to answer them yourself. Or even better, that you mix and match questions from different sets and combine them ones you come up with, to create your own set of annual review questions that you can add to and come back to yearly.</p><h2>Question Set A</h2><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">What 20% of activities, experiences or people produced 80% or more of your positive emotions/outcomes this past year?</p></li><li><p class="">What 20% of the activities, experiences or people produced 80% of the negative emotions/outcomes you experienced this past year?</p></li><li><p class="">If we assume there are only two emotions, love and fear, which in this moment are you feeling, or which is causing you to behave in a certain way?</p></li><li><p class="">If you could only use a $100 right now to most increase your happiness, how would you use it?

Not only is he a Swiss-Mexican-Costa Rican filmmaker, but he's also a creative, writer and entrepreneur. He's none other than my good friend, Andrés Bronnimann.</p><p class="">I was excited to invite Andrés onto the podcast to celebrate the release of his first feature-length documentary entitled, "The Universality of It All". The film focuses on the topics of human migration, climate change and social inequality, and blurs the boundaries between film and documentary. I was also curious about what he learned from making the film, as well as his creative and entrepreneurial processes he picked up as an independent filmmaker with 30+ productions in 25+ countries.</p><p class="">I learned so much about the themes of his film, as well as the behind-the-scenes trials and tribulations that come the hefty endeavor that is making a documentary. We also dug into the inner experience of being a creative, discussing the importance of authenticity, gratitude, and perspective in our work. I know you're going to walk away from the episode with so many gems to revisit!</p>

He comes from a family of African traditional healers and is a Bokor, one who has been initiated into Fa (Ifa) - the West African geomantic system of divination. As a Davis United World College Scholar, he graduated from Middlebury College in the USA, with a bachelors degree in international politics, economics, and African Studies. He founded ReVodution: Voodoo Education to educate the world about African spiritual traditions and co-founded Jaspora to build a community for the African diaspora in Japan. He's currently a Yenching Scholar at Yenching Academy of Peking University.</p>

<p class=""><a href="https://avthar.buzzsprout.com/1220963/6245137-surprising-misconceptions-about-african-traditional-spirituality"><strong>Surprising misconceptions about African Traditional Spirituality</strong></a></p><p class="">To this day, traditional African spiritual practices are banned in many countries and depicted as "evil" in many TV shows around the world. In this clip, guest Sena Voncujovi describes his experiences being an African spiritual practitioner and how he has seen African Spirituality being misunderstood as Satanic, by Africans and foreigners alike. Sena explains how these misconceptions have shaped the world's view of African Spirituality in a negative and degrading light.</p><p class=""><a href="https://avthar.buzzsprout.com/1220963/6245149-how-this-ghanaian-japanese-entrepreneur-bridges-the-gap-between-africa-and-asia"><strong>How this Ghanaian-Japanese Entrepreneur bridges the gap between Africa and Asia</strong></a></p><p class="">In this clip, guest Sena Voncujovi describes his experience of being a bridge between Africa and Asia through his life and work. Sena describes how his commitment to invest in Japan led him to work with Ashinaga, a Tokyo-based non-profit organization. Sena talks us through his experience working alongside Japanese and African scholars, educating them on areas like social entrepreneurship, African development.</p><p class=""><a href="https://avthar.buzzsprout.com/1220963/6245167-how-digital-media-helps-reveal-the-truth-about-african-spirituality"><strong>How digital media helps reveal the truth about African Spirituality</strong></a></p><p class="">We live in an age where we're just one post, picture or video away from reaching thousands of people. This power of digital media and social media platforms is something my guest, Sena Voncujovi, realized he could use to better educate the world about African Spirituality, from the perspective of a practitioner. In this clip, Sena Voncujovi describes the incredible journey of how he created the ReVodution film series, films which challenge the world's perspective of African Spirituality and what it actually entails.</p><p class=""><a href="https://avthar.buzzsprout.com/1220963/6245308-overcome-information-overwhelm-by-deciding-for-yourself"><strong>Overcome information overwhelm by deciding for yourself</strong></a></p><p class="">"I think it's very important for you to be able to decide for themselves, especially in this age of too much information. You're going to be fired with information. You're going to have to decide. My approach has always been to try it first...and If you're going to fail, fail fast, fail early, fail you and learn and be able to adapt quickly"</p><p class="">In this clip, Avthar and guest Sena Voncujovi explore the importance of learning from your lived experience and deciding for yourself. They describe the value of independent thinking in a world of informational overwhelm and subtle manipulation through social media and news. They also give you a framework for how you can make informed decisions from your first-hand experiences.</p><p class=""><a href="https://avthar.buzzsprout.com/1220963/6245332-japan-s-response-to-blm-protests"><strong>Japan's response to BLM protests</strong></a></p><p class="">The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement took the world by storm in 2020, demonstrating a worldwide stand against racial inequality and police brutality. In many places, BLM protests were met with more violence and brutality, while in others they took place undisturbed. In this clip guest Sena Voncujovi describes his experience in taking part in a BLM protest in Japan alongside 3000 other protesters, in a march led by the Japanese police.</p><p class=""><a href="https://avthar.buzzsprout.com/1220963/6245365-what-is-holding-the-entrepreneur-in-you-back"><strong>What is holding the Entrepreneur in YOU back?</strong></a></p><p class="">"You don't need to have everything set in order to start."</p><p class="">This was just one of the sage pieces of advice Sena Voncujovi dropped for aspiring entrepreneurs in this fire clip. Sena talks about how planning and preparing held him back from taking action and how he learned to fail and learn quickly in order to succeed as an entrepreneur. How many of us spend our lives waiting for someone else to give us the go ahead or that final push into doing what we truly love or are passionate about? Avthar and Sena discuss what's holding you back, as well as the effect of people who surround you on your growth and ambition.</p>

<p class=""><a href="https://avthar.buzzsprout.com/1220963/6245467-should-africans-who-ve-studied-abroad-return-home"><strong>Should Africans who've studied abroad return home?</strong></a></p><p class="">Should African students who've studied abroad return home? If so, when is the best time? In this clip, Avthar and guest Sena Voncujovi, two Africans who've lived and studied aboard, wrestle with these questions in the context of their own lives. They talk about timelines for returning to Africa, how you can return home without making an impact and how you can impact your home country through your work abroad, using the example of Sena's work with African entrepreneurs while living in Japan.</p><p class=""><a href="https://avthar.buzzsprout.com/1220963/6245491-creating-african-leaders-at-african-leadership-academy"><strong>Creating African leaders at African Leadership Academy</strong></a></p><p class="">In this clip, guest Sena Voncujovi describes his experience with the African Leadership Group, an organization dedicated to producing the next generation of leaders on the African continent. Sena talks about his time at African Leadership Academy in South Africa, as well as being the first study abroad student from a US institution at African Leadership University in Mauritius. He highlights how these experiences impacted his life and shaped his passion for Africa.</p><p class=""><a href="https://avthar.buzzsprout.com/1220963/6246388-young-vodu-priest-explains-african-traditional-spirituality-in-2020"><strong>Young Vodu priest explains African Traditional Spirituality in 2020</strong></a></p><p class="">Guest Sena Voncujovi has been practicing African traditional spirituality for over 12 years. He's nicknamed "Bokor Costa Rica" and "Bokor Worldwide", as he's shared his knowledge about Vodu and African spiritual practices passed down to him by his father with folks from all over the world, during his time in the USA, Costa Rica, and Japan. In this clip, Sena describes his family heritage of traditional healing, why African spirituality became associated with Satan (hint: the media), and his experience teaching Africans and non-Africans (westerners, asians) the truth about Vodu. He also tells us how he leverages digital media like film and livestreams, and social media platforms like Facebook, to give the world a practitioner's perspective of African Traditional Spirituality.</p><p class=""><a href="https://avthar.buzzsprout.com/1220963/6246433-by-speaking-with-others-we-learn-about-ourselves-how-this-afro-asian-entrepreneur-found-his-strengths"><strong>By speaking with others, we learn about ourselves - How this Afro-Asian Entrepreneur found his Strengths</strong></a></p><p class="">There are elements of our identity that are subconscious, but when we become an "other", they become crystalized. So the more we put ourselves in situations that we become an "other", the more we actually learn about ourselves, about identity and what makes us unique in the world.</p><p class="">In this clip, guest Sena Voncujovi describes how he found his strengths by exposing himself to as many things as possible and taking in as many different perspectives as he could. He also talks with Avthar about how others can go about replicating his process of self discovery.</p>

I wanted to share their stories and hard-earned lessons and help others get an overview of how they can build similar systems using all open source components.</p><h2>Abstract</h2><p class="">Are proprietary monitoring solutions too clunky, rigid and expensive for the specific needs of your fast moving team? Join me as I detail how data collection, storage and visualization can be accomplished in simple, and cost effective ways using ALL open source software!</p><p class="">You’ll hear stories from the field of how 3 different companies that I’ve worked with at Timescale have gone about implementing their open-source observability stack, how their configurations have fared and the pros and cons of each approach.</p><p class="">We’ll also architect an application monitoring system using tools like Prometheus, PostgreSQL and Grafana. All of these technologies are open-source and provide the flexibility and extensibility to scale with your team’s needs.</p><p class="">You’ll walk away with the foundation for how to implement your own observability system using open source software, as well as inspiration for how to proceed based on the real world experience of others.</p><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p class="">I’m grateful for the help of folks on the amazing Timescale team, like Lacey Butler, Prashant Sridharan and Ryan Booz. </p><p class="">This talk would also not be possible without the contributions of the engineers I interviewed for the talk: Sean Sube (WhenIWork), Miguel Farrajota (Jungle) and Sam Gichohi, Lee Hampton and Anthony Dodd (Timescale).</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e50ac0a8bf5a551ea5e5f85/1603723686453-N0U704ABVI878FA1HMUE/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGZkTHxSiNqnwUsFY6tX2kxZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpxvLuCTgGxUat1hWt6wmf1JX52nHwwMr3Dp4YLLquh0b3xg7mbl4MHoUvQXEiotQDc/OSS_ELC_EU20_102020_Snackables_v1-01.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="640" height="334"><media:title type="plain">Purpose-built observability solutions using open-source software (Open Source Summit Europe 2020)</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Finding Your Own Way</title><category>Self-Mastery</category><category>Happiness</category><dc:creator>Avthar Sewrathan</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 17:19:28 +0000</pubDate><link>https://avthar.com/blog/own-way</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e50ac0a8bf5a551ea5e5f85:5e50ac72dbfcb2688ef4330b:5f78b136c276087d2cd30890</guid><description><![CDATA[I want to share two takes on this theme of “Finding Your Own Way” from some

<p class="">Recently, I've been thinking about self-awareness and its role in living a successful and peaceful life.&nbsp;<strong>Self awareness goes hand in hand with the theme of “Finding Your Own Way”.</strong>&nbsp;I think this is especially relevant in a world where many people are trying to emulate their heroes, while all the ‘heroes’ are often just giving out their winning lottery numbers.&nbsp;</p><p class="">These methods and hacks, which happen to have worked for the heroes, don’t generalize. Ultimately leading people, who attempt to follow their hero's methods, to failure or unhappiness. A timely example would be people piggybacking on Michael Jordan’s attitudes and methods used to achieve success in basketball, as documented in the TV Series, “The Last Dance” and hailing it as “<em>the</em>&nbsp;way to success”. (My opinion is that what made MJ great was that he did it&nbsp;<em>his own way</em>.)&nbsp;</p><p class="">I want to share two takes on this theme of “Finding Your Own Way” from some of my favorite individuals, one from from the ‘angel (investor) philosopher’, Naval Ravikant and his friend, performance advisor, Kapil Gupta, and the other from Mr Art of Learning himself, Josh Waitzkin.</p><h3><strong>Naval Ravikant and Kapil Gupta on Finding Your Own Way</strong></h3><p class="">KAPIL GUPTA<strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Prescriptions or “How To’s” are hacks. They are techniques and methods, various methodologies to get somewhere.&nbsp;</p><p class="">...The problem is that whenever you venture into the realm of art, in any form (in business or sports or even in the setting of finding peace in your life or freedom or arriving at enlightenment or all of these so called spiritual pursuits) those things cannot be prescription.</p><p class="">...The Buddha attained enlightenment, you have Michael Jordan, and Tiger Woods doing amazing things in golf, and Elon Musk, and various individuals who do great things in business and even yourself (Naval).&nbsp;<strong>If you take what those people did, and you write a book that said, “These people did X.” If you follow that, you will not become them. You will not.</strong></p><p class="">NAVAL RAVIKANT:&nbsp;I’ve found business biographies to be useless for building a great business. They're good for inspiration. I can read Steve Jobs, his bio and be inspired but I can't be Steve Jobs.&nbsp;<strong>And if I want to be amazing at something, then I have to find my own way there.&nbsp;</strong>For mechanical things, “How To’s” work, but when you're trying to operate at the top of a field, when you're trying to do something creative, “How To’s” don't work beyond the most extreme basics.</p><p class="">...If you want to be the best in the world at anything, you cannot follow a prescription. If you want to be okay at it, then sure, you can follow prescription. If you want to learn how to lose a pound a month and get in decent shape, then you can follow a calorie counting worksheet. But if you want to be a shredded bodybuilder or an Olympic athlete, you're not going to get there through “How To’s”.&nbsp;<strong>You're going to have to create and forge your own path that is unique to you.</strong></p><p class=""><em>For more, listen to the&nbsp;</em><a href="https://youtu.be/sBtuqpNZwio"><em>full conversation</em></a><em>&nbsp;between Naval Ravikant (</em><a href="https://twitter.com/naval"><em>@naval</em></a><em>) and Kapil Gupta (</em><a href="https://twitter.com/KapilGuptaMD"><em>@KapilGuptaMD</em></a><em>) on Youtube.</em></p><h3><strong>Josh Waitzkin on Finding Your Own Way</strong></h3><p class="">JOSH WAITZKIN:&nbsp;<strong>One of the most common mistakes that I see people make, whether you're talking with kids or adults, in the learning curve is trying to do it, like someone else does it.&nbsp;</strong>Whether it's your dad, or your hero, or Michael Jordan, or Tiger Woods, or whatever the sport is, there are people who are who are at the top, and&nbsp;<strong>you can try to do it like somebody else. But then it's very different from trying to figure out the relationship to the art which is completely your own</strong>.</p><p class="">...the path [to mastery] should be different for everybody, depending on what someone's personalities like, what their biases are, what their past is.</p><p class="">If you take investors, there might be an investment, which one from the outside we think is objectively good. But it really isn't&nbsp;<em>objectively good</em>. It has to fit into one's portfolio of investments in a way that emerges from one's own mental models. Otherwise, it is not a form of self expression. Then, when you enter volatility, you're not gonna know what to do with it.</p><p class="">And so, I believe that&nbsp;<strong>this theme of self expression, and attunement to oneself and developing one's own mental models, is utterly critical in the learning process.</strong>&nbsp;And one of the most dangerous things that anyone can do is to try to copy others’ mental models.&nbsp;<strong>It's better to have none than to copy others, because then when the storm comes, you're going to not have a compass to navigate with</strong>.”</p><p class=""><em>For more sage wisdom, I compiled my favorite themes from Josh Waitzkin’s book and interviews with Tim Ferriss in&nbsp;</em><a href="https://avthar.com/blog/jw-curation"><em>The Ultimate Guide to Josh Waitzkin</em></a><em>.

In 2013 he hopped onto his first flight, in pursuit of adventure and an education. He studied the International Baccalaureate Diploma at the United World College of Costa Rica. He holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Management Science and Engineering from Stanford University, where he attended as a MasterCard Foundation Scholar. Ramarea currently studies Decision and Risk Analysis in the Department of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford.</p><p class="">He believes he is in this world to love and to be loved. One of the ways he hopes to love, is through catalyzing the impact of initiatives and projects aimed at ending economic poverty. He plans to do this primarily by applying his engineering education to support rational and intelligent decision-making within high-impact organizations.</p><p class="">Born and raised in Botswana, Ramarea has a bias towards organizations that work in or on Emerging Markets. He also hopes to help end economic poverty by investing in youth-owned businesses in Botswana and providing mentorship to academically gifted students from marginalized backgrounds.</p><p class="">At a personal level, Ramarea has devoted his life to nurturing his love more than his violence, as his contribution towards the collective healing from patriarchal trauma. He remains active in the UWC movement; serving on the UWC National Committee of Botswana and volunteering as an adult mentor in the annual retreat on the Constructive Engagement of Conflict at UWC USA. In his spare time, Ramarea enjoys cooking, journaling, and spending time with loved ones.</p><p class="">You can follow Ramarea on Facebook at:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ramareabw/">https://www.facebook.com/ramareabw/</a>&nbsp;and on his website&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ramarea.com/">www.ramarea.com</a></p><h2>Episode Highlights</h2><p class="">I've also pulled the best highlights from the podcast for you to listen to here:</p><h3>Clip 1: 6 Strategies for Success from Princeton and Stanford Grads</h3><p class="">Guest Ramarea Tumisang shares how being open to feedback, setting smart goals and remembering that he's human, helped him on his journey from a village in Botswana to graduating Stanford University.

Since then I've listened to hundreds of hours of podcasts while walking to class on Princeton's campus, traveling to New York, California and Dubai and in the mundane moments of doing dishes and cooking. Podcasts are undisputedly my favorite content format and the format from which I've learned the most. I consider podcasts a natural medium of expression for me.</p><p class="sqsrte-large">Reason #2: I want to learn from my guests</p><p class="">I started this podcast with a selfish motive: have conversations with people who I want to learn from and talk about things I'm curious about. I've observed this strategy work well with my podcast heroes like Joe Rogan, who record&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/8xRz8ra9mdI">5 hour podcasts</a>&nbsp;and always talk about things they're truly interested in. Even if no one else listens, I would learn something from each episode.</p><p class="sqsrte-large">#3: I love helping people learn</p><p class="">I love helping people learn. I helped students during my time as a&nbsp;<a href="https://avthar.substack.com/p/top-5-time-management-tools-from">Learning Coach</a>&nbsp;at Princeton and now I help software engineers as a&nbsp;<a href="https://avthar.com/blog/developer-advocate">Developer Advocate</a>&nbsp;at Timescale. Learn with Avthar is a way for me to help myself and my audience learn and, in the words of Charlie Munger, become learning machines and level up their life.</p><p class="sqsrte-large">Reason #4: I want to remind myself of truths I've learned in life</p><p class="">I want to use my conversations as an opportunity to remind myself of truths I've learned in my time on Earth so far, whether they be about self-master, startups, health or happiness. It helps me move from intellectual understanding to internalizing lessons more deeply such that become a ingrained in my being.</p><h2>Goals for Learn with Avthar</h2><p class="">In the early days of this podcast, my goal is to do at least 20 interviews between launch (September 2020) and March 2021, with 10 guests people in my network who I want to learn more from and the other 10 being from people I've never met before, but admire and have learned from, either through their work or by following them on Twitter.</p><p class="">I'll revisit this blog come March 2021 to see where the podcast has taken me.</p><p class="">If you or someone you know would make an awesome guest for the podcast reach out to me on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/avthars">@avthars</a>) or email me at avthar@avthar.com.</p><h2>Never miss an episode</h2><p class="">To ensure you never miss an episode of Learn with Avthar, subscribe to&nbsp;<a href="https://avthar.substack.com/">my email list</a>. </p><p class="">You'll get notified when a new episode drops, and also get my best lessons about self-master, startups, health and happiness, as well as podcast bonuses like transcripts and extra clips.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e50ac0a8bf5a551ea5e5f85/1600401362024-ZD6B78L8HIQ2ZL8C25BB/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHldqyjDwaeS7kYSmaCmglZ7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmxIv-U8QkF7Aqck8oUqvfAAOvy8DUzW3k1lLKw2Wu7uCpNBpi2q7oKJPU7loduYjD/Copy+of+Learn+with+Avthar+Blue_+White.png?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1400" height="1400"><media:title type="plain">Learn with Avthar: The podcast that helps you become a Learning Machine</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>How to Find Your Strengths: The Ultimate Guide</title><category>Self-Mastery</category><category>Career</category><dc:creator>Avthar Sewrathan</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 02:00:47 +0000</pubDate><link>https://avthar.com/blog/strengths</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e50ac0a8bf5a551ea5e5f85:5e50ac72dbfcb2688ef4330b:5f4ef4e9e558153043f8ffc1</guid><description><![CDATA[Awareness of your strengths helps you maximize your impact.

<p class="">Awareness of my unique strengths and how I positively impact people is something that’s helped me succeed as a student, entrepreneur and become a happier, more fulfilled person.</p><p class="">I want to share some two frameworks that have helped me paint a more high definition picture of my strengths and skills, as well as my passions and interests.&nbsp;</p><p class="">The frameworks are</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Reflection</p></li><li><p class="">Your Reflected Best Self</p></li></ol><p class="">My hope is that you use these frameworks to recognize your unique strengths and areas of&nbsp;<a href="https://avthar.substack.com/p/-natural-leverage-learning-lenses">natural leverage</a>, and then redesign your life around them, thus maximizing your impact and fulfillment.</p><h1><strong>1. Reflection</strong></h1><p class="">Reflection is a powerful tool to help you uncover your true passions and strengths. It’s unsurprising that many of the world’s top performers (like&nbsp;<a href="https://avthar.com/blog/jw-curation">Josh Waitzkin</a>) and great leaders (like&nbsp;<a href="https://dailystoic.com/meditations-marcus-aurelius/">Marcus Aurelius</a>) habitually reflected in writing.</p>

<h4><strong>Reflect on your past to find activities and areas that you enjoyed or excelled in.&nbsp;</strong></h4><h4><strong>This will help you narrow down your areas to which you’re naturally suited and in which you’re highly skilled.</strong></h4><p class="">We’re all so busy planning and doing that we seldom make time to reflect on our journey, our motives and how we’re impacting other people.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Reflecting and doing are like swimming and breathing. When you swim, you come up for air after every few strokes with your head down in the water. This allows you to keep on swimming with fresh air in your lungs.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><h4><strong>Similarly, making time to periodically reflect on your life and your past experiences, gives you fresh insights and connections that you can then apply to live a more impactful and fulfilling life.</strong></h4></blockquote><p class="">I learned the value of reflection while in high school at UWC. It was mandatory to submit reflections on our academic and extracurricular experiences at the end of every trimester. After shaking off the feeling of being ‘forced’ to reflect, I found that it gave me the headspace to examine the past trimester and see which projects and activities I enjoyed and excelled in, while documenting learnings about myself in the process.</p><h2><strong>15 Questions to Help you Find your Strengths</strong></h2>

<p class="">When reflecting, it helps to have guiding questions to focus your mind and structure your thoughts around. Here are some questions that I’ve found useful for you to meditate and reflect on, in order to recognize your strengths:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>When did you feel flow?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What are you curious about?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Which activities bring you joy?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What did you enjoy growing up?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What activities feel natural to you?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What does your gut say you enjoy?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What are your 12 favorite problems?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What did you enjoy creating in the past?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>When did you pick up a new skill easily?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>How do you bring value to other people?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What would you work on if money wasn’t an issue?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What looks like work to others, but is actually fun to you?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What areas/ activities/ categories do you keep coming back to?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What do you enjoy listening to podcasts, watching videos and/or reading books about?</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>What are times in your life when you’ve felt completely aligned with what you’re doing?</strong></p></li></ol><p class="">Pose these questions to yourself and then write down everything your mind comes up with in response. Construct experiments around those answers to test if they are true.</p><h4><strong>Repeat the reflection exercise again (once a month, every 3-6 months or once a year) in order to see which answers keep coming up.&nbsp;</strong></h4><h4><strong>Patterns will emerge and will guide you toward your areas of true strength for you to further explore</strong></h4><p class="">Reflection will require your time and effort, but that investment reaps the returns of learning more about yourself and better understanding your core strengths.</p><h2><strong>Desired strengths vs Actual strengths</strong></h2>

<h4><strong>You must be disciplined to separate the things you&nbsp;<em>want to be&nbsp;</em>strengths from the things that are&nbsp;<em>actually&nbsp;</em>strengths.&nbsp;</strong></h4><p class="">In college, I wanted to be an excellent programmer, mostly to motivate myself to get As in my computer science classes. I told myself that because I was interested in technology that programming is a core strength of mine. This was actually a&nbsp;<em>desired strength</em>, something that I wanted to be great at, but wasn’t yet.</p><p class="">But after struggling in certain CS classes and excelling in other non-CS classes like philosophy and design, I realized that while I’m a good, competent programmer,&nbsp; I’ll probably never be a great programmer, despite being passionate about technology and how it can empower people. I also realized that my&nbsp;<em>actual strengths</em>&nbsp;lay elsewhere, in areas like speaking, teaching and writing. These were areas that felt like play to me but looked like work to others, and are areas that I did have a shot at being world class at. This distinction between my desired vs actual strengths only became clear to me through reflection.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><strong>Reflection also helped me orient my life and career to leverage my interests and strengths.</strong>&nbsp;Rather than try to be the best software engineer ever, I realized the best thing was to actually combine my decent programming skills and my passion for technology with my other people-oriented strengths in order to build technology-enabled products. Looking back, my current work of being a&nbsp;<a href="https://avthar.com/blog/developer-advocate">Developer Advocate</a>actually leverages the best of my strengths and interest in technology: I still write code, but also do lots of writing, speaking and teaching. Reflect on how you can leverage your actual strengths in your current work, so that you can further develop your strengths and maximize your impact.</p><h2><strong>Searching vs Recognizing</strong></h2>

<p class="">Your strengths aren’t playing hide and seek with you. You’re searching for your strengths and passions, but they’re often hidden in plain sight. The goal of reflection is to develop an awareness of your areas of strength and passion, as well as gaining confidence to embrace them.</p><blockquote><h4><strong>By reflecting, you’re searching to find things that we’re apparent to you in the past.&nbsp;</strong></h4></blockquote><p class="">You’re looking for clues about why you have the strengths you do. You’re also looking for more precise vocabulary to describe things that you're already good at. For example, instead of just saying “I have people skills”, you’ll more precisely frame your strength as “being good in small group environments and easily connecting with people by building comfort and trust”.</p><p class="">Beyond searching, reflection also helps you recognize your areas of natural interest and competence. It helps you look at your past activities with the benefit of hindsight in order to find things you resonated with and excelled in. As we move through different stages of life,&nbsp; from school to the working world, to marriage and parenthood, we might accidentally drop our areas of passion and strength. For example, as you transition from university to the working world, you might have dropped exploring certain interests and doing certain activities in order to adapt to your busy schedule and family demands.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Reflection helps you recognize past strengths, see how they manifested in your life since then and if they still apply today.</strong></h4><h4><strong>It helps surface areas and activities which you might not have thought were a big deal at the time, but might actually be core strengths.</strong></h4><h1><strong>2. Your Reflected Best Self</strong></h1>

<p class="">I want to introduce you to an exercise which profoundly changed my life. I first did this exercise as a 20 year old college student and it shifted the way I think about my strengths, how I do my best work and how I can add value to the world.&nbsp;</p><p class="">It’s called the&nbsp;<strong>Reflected Best Self (RBS).</strong></p><p class="">The Reflected Best Self is a powerful exercise that gives you a 360 degree view of your strengths. During the RBS exercise, you’ll look outward and collect and synthesize feedback from people who’ve seen you at your best in various spheres of your life, both personal and professional.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><h4><strong>The RBS will help you examine the impact you’ve made on people in different parts of your life and nudge you to redesign your life around your strengths, so that you can maximize impact and personal fulfillment.&nbsp;</strong></h4></blockquote><p class="">At the end, you’ll be able to answer the question,<strong>&nbsp;“</strong>When am I at my best?”</p>

<h2><strong>The RBS helps you double down on your strengths</strong></h2><p class="">We live in a society where feedback is synonymous with weakness. When we ask people for feedback on something, we expect to hear things like “<em>You did this wrong. You're not good enough here. This is where you need to improve</em>.”&nbsp;</p><p class="">However, we very rarely get praised on the things that we're good at. To become world class in our crafts, we must identify our areas of strength and double down on them.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><h4><strong>The RBS will give you a 360 degree view of your strengths and who you are at your best according to people from different parts of your life.&nbsp;</strong></h4></blockquote><p class="">This RBS helps to correct the bias we have about our own strengths by providing us with feedback about how we impact people around us. Often these qualities are so natural to us that we don’t consider them as strengths and perhaps don’t give ourselves that recognition that we deserve for these strengths.</p><h2><strong>The RBS helps separate your Desired vs Actual Strengths</strong></h2><p class="">Most people look at strengths as aspirational -- “What would I&nbsp;<em>like</em>&nbsp;to be good at?”.&nbsp; This could be because of peer influence, our ego, societal pressure etc. These are&nbsp;<em>Desired</em>&nbsp;strengths. The RBS exercise is a helpful tool to recognize our&nbsp;<em>Actual</em>&nbsp;strengths because it separates actions from aspirations.</p><blockquote><h4><strong>Friends, family and people we’ve worked closely with are actually better at telling us what we're good at because they see us in action.&nbsp;</strong></h4></blockquote><p class="">By focusing on times they saw you at your best, they help us discover our&nbsp;<em>actual strengths</em>&nbsp;as their answers will draw on times where you’ve demonstrated your strengths in practice.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Looking back at things you’ve actually done is a better indicator of who you are at your best than who you imagine yourself to be, or what you desire to be good at. And who better than people remind us of our best moments from different spheres in our life and help us find moments we didn’t think were a big deal but were significant to them and deserve more of our attention?</p><h2><strong>How to do the RBS Exercise</strong></h2><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">List 10+ people from different parts of your life</p></li><li><p class="">Ask them, “When was I at my best?” and collect their responses</p></li><li><p class="">Look for patterns in the responses</p></li><li><p class="">Compose your self portrait of who you are at your best</p></li><li><p class="">Redesign your life around your strengths</p></li></ol><h2><strong>RBS Step 1: Make a list</strong></h2><h4><strong>Make a list of 10+ people from different contexts in your life who have seen you at your best.</strong></h4>

These are the people who will give you insight into your strengths and the impact you have on people.</p><p class="">We all have different areas in our life where people see us at our best: parents, high school, friends, past jobs, internships, our work teammates, people that we've done group projects, college friends, your manager, boss, teachers, mentors, family members, people from clubs you’ve joined etc.</p><p class="">By gathering input from a variety of sources—family members, past and present colleagues, friends, teachers, and so on—you can develop a much broader and richer understanding of yourself than you can from a standard performance evaluation.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><h4><strong>It’s often these people (friends, family, teammates) who know what our greatest strengths are, but never had the chance to tell us.</strong></h4></blockquote><p class="">Take for example, how entrepreneur and investor&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/naval">Naval Ravikant</a>&nbsp;recounts how it was his mother (!) who pointed out his real strengths (he calls this specific knowledge):</p><blockquote><p class="">“<em>The first person to actually point out my real specific knowledge (natural strengths) was my mother...I was telling a friend of mine that I want to be an astrophysicist and she said, “No, you’re going to go into business.”&nbsp;</em></p><p class=""><em>She’d already observed that every time we walk down the street, I would critique the local pizza parlor on why they were selling their slices a certain way with certain toppings and why their process of ordering was this way when it should have been that way.&nbsp;</em></p><p class=""><em>So, she knew that I had more of a business curious mind, but then my obsession with science combined to create technology and technology businesses where I found myself.&nbsp;</em></p><p class=""><strong><em>So, very often, your specific knowledge (natural strength) is observed and often observed by other people who know you well and revealed in situations rather than something that you come up with.</em>”</strong></p></blockquote><p class="">Write down at least 10-15 people from the areas above. Not everyone will respond, so aim for as many as possible.

<h4><strong>You want to ask each person on your list a simple question: “Can you please describe a time or times where you've seen me at my best”</strong></h4><p class="">One rule for this step: Do not change the wording.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="">This question is intentionally open ended. It’s designed to elicit more genuine and authentic responses than asking “what are my strengths?”.</p></blockquote><p class="">It focuses on actions and forces the responder to be specific about the context in which you demonstrated the strength in the past. It bypasses the responder’s analytical filter and maneuvers around responses they think you might like in order to arrive at something more genuine and sincere.</p><p class="">Block off up to 2 weeks to get responses. Don’t be afraid to follow up after a week to remind people to respond.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><strong>Pro tip</strong>: The easiest way to collect responses is with a Google form like this:</p>

<h2><strong>Step 3: Look for patterns in the responses</strong></h2><h4><strong>After you’ve gathered all your responses, process them to find patterns.</strong></h4><p class="">Responses will cluster together around themes. Several people might point to the same skill or same context in which you’re at your best. Some might point to things that you may have not initially thought of as areas of strength (often interpersonal skills). Rest assured that if you’ve asked a large enough sample of people, there will be commonalities and things that keep coming up that you won’t be able to ignore.</p><p class="">Make sure to note down recurring themes, even if you initially don't agree with them.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="">We often internalize our expertise and activities of maximum impact so much that we don’t consider them to be strengths.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p class=""><strong>Pro tip:</strong>&nbsp;To help you process the responses, you can create a table of common themes, instances of the theme, who noticed and your interpretation:</p>

Consider the following questions:</p><blockquote><p class="">How can you spend more time practicing your areas of strength?</p><p class="">How can you make life decisions in order to optimize for your strengths?</p><p class="">What activities, practices and experiences will deepen your mastery and increase your impact?</p><p class="">How can you use your unique strengths to bring value and happiness to yourself and those around you?</p></blockquote><h4><strong>How can you reorient your work and life to use your strengths?</strong></h4><p class="">Having knowledge of your strengths allows you to (re)orient your career and work to use your strengths and further refine them.</p><p class="">This could mean taking on more responsibility in your current job, starting new side projects during nights and weekends, or something as drastic as finding a new job in a role that’s more aligned with your strengths.</p><p class="">For example, if you’re a founder or team leader, defining your&nbsp;<a href="https://fs.blog/2013/12/circle-of-competence/">Circle of Competence</a>, the areas in which you are best suited, allows you to leverage your strengths and then offset your areas of weakness by delegating or hiring others who are world class at them.</p><blockquote><p class="">At the very least, knowledge of when you are at your best gives you license to explore and try new things that you think would best utilize your strengths.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p class="">Consider this an invitation to question your assumptions of what you thought you could achieve and be and start from scratch, using your RBS and Self Portrait as a compass.</p><h4><strong>What activities can help you further develop?</strong></h4><p class="">Your RBS will identify areas where you are good or even great at.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="">With the right nurturing and practice, you can go from good to great to world class in your areas of strength.&nbsp;</p><p class="">This allows you to have more of an impact with your strengths and ultimately, escape competition through authenticity.</p></blockquote><p class="">You could get expert coaching, enroll in courses, find mentors or simply seek out like-minded people who are trying to level up on the same skill. Using myself as an example, in trying to improve my written communication and double down on my strength of sharing knowledge, I enrolled in a writing course (<a href="https://www.perell.com/write-of-passage">Write of Passage</a>) and started this newsletter to keep me accountable.</p><p class="">Further education and a commitment to improving your strengths helps you improve and creates a positive feedback loop where you spend more time harnessing your strengths, since you’ve invested in improving them.</p><h2><strong>Your Turn + The RBS Starter Kit</strong></h2><p class="">Now that you’ve seen all 5 steps of the Reflected Best Self Exercise, it’s your turn to try it and unlock a deeper understanding of your strengths and who you are at your best!</p><p class="">If you’re looking to deepen your self-awareness, understand how you can make the best impact or just looking to be world class at what you do, the RBS take you to the next level.</p><h4><strong>To help you get started, I’ve put together an&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://avthar.com/blog/rbs-starter-kit"><span><strong>RBS Starter Kit</strong></span></a><strong>&nbsp;to kickstart your journey.</strong></h4><p class="">The&nbsp;<a href="https://avthar.com/blog/rbs-starter-kit"><strong>starter kit</strong></a>&nbsp;contains scripts, templates and sample artifacts which I’ve developed for myself when doing my yearly RBS.

<h3>📲Message Scripts</h3><p class="">Here’s the exact script I used to reach out to people in order to ask them to respond to the survey. You can use this verbatim or as the basis for your outreach message. I usually reached out to people in the place I talked with them, so Slack and email for co-workers, and text / Whatsapp/ Facebook for friends and family.</p><p class=""><strong>For colleagues/ boss / professional contexts:</strong><br></p>
